A React app hosted at [wheresjethro.com](https://wheresjethro.com/) which loads "check-ins" returned from the API, and plots them to a map. Also allows admin to add check-ins via a form which uses their device GPS to fetch their current location.
- React 17.0.2
- react-map-gl

Works with [wheres-jethro-api](https://github.com/jro31/wheres-jethro-api).
